# 06-Server-Side-APIs

Sixth homework for UNH Coding Bootcamp: Weather Dashboard.  I built the dashboard from scratch, starting with creating a basic index.html and then dynamically adding elements to the screen using javascript and adding various styles via css.  I used materialize instead of bootstrap to practice learning a new CSS framework.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS and CSS Framework: Materialize, JaveScript, jQuery, AJAX and API requests  

Parts of Website: 

1. User can search for weather reports by city using the [openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. After searching for a city, the user will see the current temperature, current humidity, windspeed, UV Index, and 5 day forecast.
3. Application uses icons to represent weather conditions.
4. Application stores previously searched for cities in local storage and displays them to the user.
5. Application loads last searched city forecast on page load.

Challenges: This project helped me understand how to use ajax calls.  It was a challenge at first, as there are nested ajax calls in this application.  At first I tried to store the weather info in local storage as an array of objects, but realized that this would not give the user the most recent weather info.
